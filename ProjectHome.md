**Android-2d-engine** is currently under construction, the project born for serve as base for games.

Actually there are two projects:

trunk/bullet: Contains the c++ source code for bullet and the jni class to communicate with android. This code is not really needed since the sample contains the compiled lib.

trunk/androgine: Contains the rest of the code needed to communicate with bullet plus a sample with profiling purposes.

The physics and collisions run at about 50-55 fps in my htc hero.

(11/04/2010) This weekend I've been rewriting some pieces of code and adding collisions communication between the jni code and android.

(19/04/2010) Solved some issues, now you are free to specify the sprites quantity
